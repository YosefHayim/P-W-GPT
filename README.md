# Past-Projects-with-ChatGPT

This folder contains various projects I have worked on with the assistance of ChatGPT. While I understand that the code generated by ChatGPT might not always follow best practices, these projects have been an important stepping stone in my journey as a junior developer.

Many of these projects, particularly those related to Amazon and eBay, were developed as part of a larger initiative to transition my dropshipping business into a SaaS platform. These projects were instrumental in automating aspects of my business, and I worked alongside other developers while adding my own touches to the solutions. The SaaS website project, for instance, is an example of this collaboration and development effort.

By experimenting with Python, JavaScript, and other technologies through these collaborations, I have gained valuable hands-on experience. These projects reflect my continuous effort to grow in the industry, learn from my work, and enhance my programming skills.
