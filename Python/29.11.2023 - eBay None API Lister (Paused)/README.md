## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- LXML (`pip install lxml`)
- ChromeDriver (ensure it matches your Chrome browser version)

## Setup

1. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium lxml
   ```

2. **Download ChromeDriver**:
   Download the correct version of ChromeDriver matching your Chrome browser from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python amazon_scraper.py
   ```

2. **Input the ASINs CSV File**:
   The script reads ASINs from a CSV file named `ASINS_EXTRACTION.csv`. Ensure this file is in the same directory as the script or provide the full path.

3. **Manual Actions**:
   Perform any manual actions needed (e.g., logging in) once the browser opens. Press Enter in the terminal to continue the script.

4. **Script Execution**:
   The script will process each ASIN, gather product data, and save it into a CSV file named `DATA_EXPORTED.csv`.

5. **Output**:
   After the script finishes, youâ€™ll have a CSV file with organized product data ready for analysis.
